# HungryMouse
Hungry Mouse is a game about finding the opponent's food on a blind board and eating it piece by piece!

Players begin the game by placing their pieces, in any orientation they like:

Validation ensures that all cheese is on the table:

Each player will then take turns taking bites and trying to find each other's cheese:

Careful - the computer's clever enough to chase down your cheese:
